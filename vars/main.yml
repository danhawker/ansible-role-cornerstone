## When building a vm for the 1st you need to create a kvm template in libvrt gui (so just a vm) make sure the vm and the image lives in cornerstone_vm_location. ONce it's created just turn the vm off

Hey Obi, yeah been away at Summit and mostly been busy with customers after that.
The network information is largely dependant on your environment. By default the subnet configuration for libvirt is 192.158.122.0/24
i normally just set the IP to one I know that is not in use, I then set the following
subnet = 255.255.255.0
Gateway = 192.168.122.1
DNS1 = 192.168.122.1
DNS2 = 8.8.8.8

nmap -sP -Pn 192.168.122.100
